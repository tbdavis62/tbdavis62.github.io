    <h1>The GOAT Argument: Why Drake Maye is the Best Quarterback EVER</h1>
<p>
    This page presents the definitive case for why Drake Maye's skills and potential elevate him above every quarterback who has ever played the game. The evidence is simply overwhelming!
</p>

<h2>🔥 Unmatched Arm Talent and Accuracy</h2>
<p>
    Drake Maye possesses a cannon for an arm, capable of making every throw in the playbook. But power is nothing without precision, and his pinpoint accuracy is what truly sets him apart from historical greats. He can fit the ball into windows that simply shouldn't exist.
</p>

<h3>Reasons His Arm is Superior:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Throws perfectly under pressure.</li>
    <li>Deep ball trajectory is flawless.</li>
    <li>Can change his arm angle without losing velocity or accuracy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>👟 Elite Athleticism and Mobility</h2>
<p>
    Unlike many pocket passers of the past, Maye combines his elite passing ability with tremendous athleticism. He is not just a quarterback, he is a threat to run for a first down every time the pocket breaks down. This dual threat ability makes him impossible for defenses to prepare for.
